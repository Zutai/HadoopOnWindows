HadoopOnWindows
===============

This project is to provide guidelines, sample codes and releated information about build, install and use hadoop on Windows.

Following are the steps (must use 64bit windows):
* Install Java (jdk 7)
* Install Cygwin
* Copy Hadoop 2.4 source code to Cygwin
* Build Hadoop source in Cygwin
* Set up Hadoop environment in Windows
* Run Hadoop in Windows

See details at my StackOverflow post: [Hadoop 2.4 (2.4.0) build, install and run on Windows 8](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24299034/hadoop-2-4-2-4-0-build-install-and-run-on-windows-8)
